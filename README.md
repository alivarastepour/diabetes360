# diabetes360

From conceptual point of view, diabetes360 aims to raise awareness about Diabetes, a chronic disease which affects how body regulates blood sugar.
From a technical point of view, this project aims to embed an ML model into a SPA, bootstrapped with Nextjs.

## Diabetes predection

To predict the possibility of Diabetes for individuals, we've trained a model on a dataset which contained records of more than 70000 people regarding their health life. You can find
the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset?select=diabetes_012_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv). You can also visit the model itself from [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/alivarastepour/diabetes_prediction/blob/master/diabetes_prediction.ipynb).
Source code is also available in this [repo](https://github.com/alivarastepour/diabetes_prediction/).

## Tech stack

Diabetes360 uses Nextjs and Typescript for development, SCSS for styling, Cypress for E2E tests and github actions for CI/CD.
